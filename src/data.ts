// RXJS [1]

/**
    RxJS is an acronym that stands for Reactive Extension for JavaScript. 
    It is a JavaScript library that is used to work with Reactive programming that deals with 
    asynchronous data calls, callbacks and event-based programs. 
    RxJS can be used with other JavaScript libraries such as Angular, ReactJS, Vue. js, Node
*/

/**
    Frontend programming is inherently asynchronous because of nature of apps runs in a browser (events)

    A new asynchronous programming concept - the stream i.e. A stream is a sequence of values in time(its as simple as that)

    for example the following stream of numeric values, where each value is issued every one second: i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3 ,4 

    let i = 0;
    setInterval(()=>{
        console.log(i++);
    }, 1000)

    Another example of a stream is a sequence of mouse click events, with the x and y mouse coordinates of the mouse click
    (100,200), (110, 300), (400, 50) ...

    document.addEventListener("mousemove", (val)=>{
        console.log(val.x, val.y)
    })

    Everything that happens in the browser can be seen as a stream e.g. : 

    1. the sequence of browser events that are triggered when the user interacts with the page,
    2. data arriving from the server
    3. timeouts getting triggered

/**
  In order for the notion of stream to be useful to build a program, we need a way to create streams, 
  subscribe to them, react to new values, and combine streams together to build new ones.

  RXJS is an implementation of Observables for Javascript.

  What is an Observable?
  An observable represents a stream, or source of data that can arrive over time. 
  You can create an observable from nearly anything, but the most common use case in RxJS is from events.

  This can be anything from mouse moves, button clicks, input into a text field, or even route changes

  The easiest way to create an observable is through the built in creation functions.
  For example, we can use the fromEvent helper function to create an observable of mouse click events:

  // import the fromEvent operator
    import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';

// grab button reference
    const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

// create an observable of button clicks
    const myObservable = fromEvent(button, 'click');

At this point we have an observable but it's not doing anything. 
This is because observables are cold, or do not activate a producer (like wiring up an event listener), until there is a SUBSCRIPTION
  
*/

/**
    Subscription :

    Subscriptions are what set everything in motion. You can think of this like a faucet, you have a stream of water ready to be tapped (observable), 
    someone just needs to turn the handle. In the case of observables, that role belongs to the subscriber

    To create a subscription, you call the subscribe method, supplying a function (or object) - also known as an observer. 
    This is where you can decide how to react(-ive programming) to each event

    // import the fromEvent operator
    import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';

    // grab button reference
    const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

    // create an observable of button clicks
    const myObservable = fromEvent(button, 'click');

    // for now, let's just log the event on each click
    const subscription = myObservable.subscribe(event => console.log(event));

    const subscription1 = myObservable.subscribe(event => console.log(event));


    ALSO

    // instead of a function, we will pass an object with next, error, and complete methods
    const subscription = myObservable.subscribe({
    // on successful emissions
    next: event => console.log(event),
    // on errors
     error: error => console.log(error),
    // called once on completion
    complete: () => console.log('complete!')
    });
*/

/**
    It's important to note that each subscription will create a new execution context. 
    This means calling subscribe a second time will create a new event listener:

    // addEventListener called
    const subscription = myObservable.subscribe(event => console.log(event));

    // addEventListener called again!
    const secondSubscription = myObservable.subscribe(event => console.log(event));

    // clean up with unsubscribe
    subscription.unsubscribe();
    secondSubscription.unsubscribe();
*/

/**
    By default, a subscription creates a one on one, one-sided conversation between the observable and observer. This is also known as unicasting

// Change Detection [1]

/**
    Out of the box, Angular provides two different change detection strategies: Default and OnPush. 
    Each strategy has its own advantages, but sometimes it is easy to miss a nifty optimization opportunity if you stick to the default strategy.

    Data flow being at the center of almost all things.

*/

/**
  1. When you change any of your models, Angular detects the changes and immediately updates the views and this is the change detection
  2. The purpose of this mechanism is to make sure the underlying views are always in sync with their corresponding models

  A model in Angular can change as a result of any of the following scenarios:

    DOM events (click, hover over, etc.)

    AJAX requests

    Timers (setTimer(), setInterval())

    1. All Angular apps are made up of a hierarchical tree of components. At runtime, Angular creates a separate change detector class for every component in the tree, 
       which then eventually forms a hierarchy of change detectors similar to the hierarchy tree of components.
    
    2. Whenever change detection is triggered, Angular walks down this tree of change detectors to determine if any of them have reported changes

    3. The change detection cycle is always performed once for every detected change and starts from the root change detector and goes all the way down in a sequential fashion

    4. This sequential design choice is nice because it updates the model in a predictable way since we know component data can only come from its parent.

    5. The change detectors provide a way to keep track of the componentâ€™s previous and current states as well as its structure in order to report changes to Angular
       If Angular gets the report from a change detector, it instructs the corresponding component to re-render and update the DOM accordingly.
